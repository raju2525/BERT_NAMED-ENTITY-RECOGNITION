# Named Entity Recognition

This project implements a machine learning-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) system that identifies and categorizes entities (like names, dates, organizations, locations, etc.) in a given text or image. It uses a fine-tuned BERT model and integrates OCR for text extraction from images.
